    <h1> Different Dog Breeds </h1>
    <p>The <strong>French Bulldog</strong> resembles a Bulldog in miniature, except for the large, erect “bat ears” that are the breed’s trademark feature. The head is large and square, with heavy wrinkles rolled above the extremely short nose. The body beneath the smooth, brilliant coat is compact and muscular.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Beagle</strong> is a scent hound, developed primarily for hunting hare (beagling). With a great sense of smell and superior tracking instinct, the beagle is employed as detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent but single-minded.</p>

    <div id = "beaglepic">
      <p>The <strong>Siberian Husky</strong> is a beautiful dog breed with a thick coat that comes in a multitude of colors and markings. Their blue or multi-colored eyes and striking facial masks only add to the appeal of this breed, which originated in Siberia.

    <div id = "corgi">
      <p>The <strong>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</strong> is an active and intelligent dog breed, originally bred to herd cattle, sheep, and horses. Easy to train and eager to learn, Pembrokes are great with children and other pets, and you can find them in four different coat colors and markings.

    <div id = "goldenpic">
      <P>The <strong>Golden Retriever</strong>is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say, with a “merry action.”

    <div id = "shihtzu">
      <p><strong>Shih Tzu</strong> (pronounced in the West “sheed-zoo” or “sheet-su”; the Chinese say “sher-zer”), weighing between 9 to 16 pounds, and standing between 8 and 11 inches, are surprisingly solid for dogs their size. The coat, which comes in many colors, is worth the time you will put into it—few dogs are as beautiful as a well-groomed Shih Tzu.
